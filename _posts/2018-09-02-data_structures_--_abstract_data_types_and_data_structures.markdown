While learning how computers process data and, ultimately, organize memory, I've continued to face a lot of names for things or functionality that sound confusingly similar. Many concepts have sounded weirdly similar and the differences appearing as the least important of nuances can actually be completely different... the computational equivalent of "they're, their and there", no similarity but sound.

The simplest explanation I've found is from StackExchange, 'ADT is to an interface (what it does) what a data structure is to a class (how it does it)', but this only gives us an appearance, again. With this, I think the imporant take away is that they are not mutually exclusive.

We've looked at data structures in my [last post](http://jordan-kline.com/data_structures_--_from_linked_list_to_heap), which looked at lists & linked lists. A linked list has methods that describe its shape and how we interact with it, but generally, does not give any information about what is happening under the hood. This is the basis of abstraction.

### (Concrete) Data Structure

Also known as a 'Data Structure', this is a representation of actual data as 'natively' supported by a language

Static
Dynamic


### Abstract Data Type


To Cite: 
ADTs are a theoretical concept in computer science, used in the design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, and software systems, and do not correspond to specific features of computer languages.

An abstract data type is defined as a mathematical model of the data objects that make up a data type as well as the functions that operate on these objects.
