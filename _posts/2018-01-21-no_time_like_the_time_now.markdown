How long can you put off the inevitable? I have scratched the surface of computer programming more than once in my life and each time I am left with the same thought, ‘little has changed’ — from the original blinking cursor on the white bash/DOS screen, the interface at its lowest level has not changed.

I’ve put off this inevitability in some ways for my whole life. I started studying C++ in high school and left more confused and frustrated, for a variety of reasons, than I had started. It brought me to choose cognitive sciences (CS) and linguistics, instead of the original CS, computer science, that I originally was considering moving toward. It seems to me that it was a different time then, when computers were looked at with more technical confusion and the complexity was seen as something that alluded to only being accessible by the nerdiest and scientifically inclined.

The landscape has changed and now something that I had always thought of as out of my reach has become irrefutable and necessary, all for the better, I am finding. Technologies that, when I first saw them, appeared stale and complicated, are now available, still complicated, but crowd sourced, well-established, more developed and accessible by simple internet searches and endless repositories of co-worked code.

Today, there are endless reasons why it’s wise to learn how to program. For job security in the coming world, for general usefulness (being able to automate parts of your life), for the superhuman abilities that come with ready access to more information and new ways of using that information programmatically, for positioning oneself in a way to grow with something that has become the forefront of modern civilization, for a cure to boredom — for fodder for the insatiably curious.

So, I feel like I am making up for lost time, to some deep degree, moving towards a goal without the guilt about having missed an earlier train. As my wife, who recently made a career change into coding, says ‘I would rather have been a painter in the Renaissance than in the Middle Ages.’ I’m not late, in fact, there is no time like the present; I am onboard and more excited than I have been in quite some time for something that promises to revolutionize my own life as much as it has the world at large.
